# Lesson 3 — Python Fundamentals for Statistical Analysis

# Assignment 3: Working with Lists and Dictionaries (100 points)

### Instructions for Students:
- Do all tasks in a Google Colab notebook.
- Use comments (#) to explain your code.
- Submit your work by sharing your Colab link.
- Total Score: 100 points

## Task 1: Creating Lists (10 points)

- Create a list called ages with the following values:

```python
[18, 20, 19, 22, 21, 20, 19]
```
- Print:
  - The first element
  - The last element
  - The length of the list

## Task 2: Modifying Lists (15 points)

- Add the value 23 to the list.
- Remove the first occurrence of 20.
- Replace the second element with 25.
- Print the updated list.

## Task 3: List Methods and Comprehensions (20 points)

- Using the updated ages list:
- Find the average age.
- Sort the list in ascending order.
- Create a new list using a list comprehension that contains only ages greater than 20.

## Task 4: Working with Dictionaries (20 points)

- Create a dictionary called student with the following keys and values:

```python
{
  "name": "Anna",
  "age": 21,
  "course": "BS Fisheries",
  "is_enrolled": True
}
```
- Print:
  - The student’s name
  - The student’s age
  - Add a new key-value pair: "grade": 92
  - Update "age" to 22
  - Delete "is_enrolled"

- Print the updated dictionary.

## Task 5: Statistical Example – Survey Data (25 points)

You conducted a survey asking 5 students how many hours they studied last week. Store the data in a dictionary like this:

```python
study_hours = {
    "Alice": 12,
    "Ben": 8,
    "Carla": 15,
    "David": 10,
    "Ella": 9
}
```

- Print the average study hours.
- Print the name of the student who studied the most hours.
- Print the name of the student who studied the least hours.

## Task 6: Nested Structures (10 points)

Create a list of dictionaries to store survey data of 3 students, each with name, age, and study_hours. Example:

```python
[
  {"name": "Anna", "age": 21, "study_hours": 12},
  {"name": "Ben", "age": 22, "study_hours": 15},
  {"name": "Carla", "age": 20, "study_hours": 10}
]
```

- Print the average study hours from this nested structure.
